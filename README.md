# Poool Subscribe - Node SDK

Poool Subscribe SDK for Node.js ðŸš€


## Installation

```
yarn add @poool/subscribe-node-sdk node-fetch query-string
```

## Usage

```javascript
import Subscribe from '@poool/subscribe-node-sdk';

const subs = Subscribe({
  clientId: 'your-client-id',
  clientSecret: 'your-client-secret',
});

subs.offers.list().then(({ offers, total }) => console.log(offers, total));
```

## Sandbox mode

You can use the sandbox mode to test your integration without any real payment.
Pass the `sandbox: true` request option (last parameter) to any method of the SDK to use it:

```javascript
subs.offers.list(1, 10, [], [], 'active', { sandbox: true })
```

## Migrations

## v1 to v2

- `customers.switchSubscriptionOffer(customerId, subscriptionId, offer, requestOptions)` becomes `customers.switchSubscriptionOffer(customerId, subscriptionId, offer, **{ priceId }**, requestOptions)` -> it now takes an additional parameter before request options to speficy offer options like price id
- `sandbox: true|false` is now an option on every request (instead of only offers list) and has been removed from `offers.list()`
